I am an incoming Ph.D. student to [Language Technologies Institute](lti.cs.cmu.edu), Carnegie Mellon University. Before that, I received my M.S. in Computer Science from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in 2022, and B.S.E in Computer Science from [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) and B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020.

I am broadly interested in various topics of machine learning, with a special research interest in the graph mining and structure discovery. My previous research experiences span the area of deep reinforcement learning, graph representation learning, information extraction, video understanding and few-shot learning.
