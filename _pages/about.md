I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Language Technologies Institute](lti.cs.cmu.edu), Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Yiming Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/). Before that, I received my M.S. in Computer Science from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in 2022, and B.S.E in Computer Science from [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) and B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020.

I am broadly interested in various topics of graph-based machine learning, including graph representation learning and structure discovery.
