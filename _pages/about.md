I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [Language Technologies Institute](lti.cs.cmu.edu), Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Yiming Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/). Before that, I received my M.S. in Computer Science from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2022, and B.S.E in Computer Science from University of Michigan and B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020.

Research Interest
======

My research focuses on developing **artificial intelligence for mathematical problem solving (AI4Math)**, with an emphasis on methods that require minimal or no human supervision. I currently pursue two primary directions: 

 * Large Language Model (LLM)-based mathematical reasoning ([FrontierCO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16952), [CO-Bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04310), [TSMC4Math](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ze4aPP0tIn))
 * Neural approaches for combinatorial optimization ([FrontierCO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16952), [RLD4CO](https://openreview.net/forum?id=bbJ0QCujU4), [SORREL](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/33219))

In addition, I apply combinatorial optimization to real-world applications such as high-performance computing, computer vision, biology, and information extraction. My earlier work spans self-supervised graph representation learning and reinforcement learning.
