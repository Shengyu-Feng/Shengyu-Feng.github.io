I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [Language Technologies Institute](lti.cs.cmu.edu), Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Yiming Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/). Before that, I received my M.S. in Computer Science from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in 2022, and B.S.E in Computer Science from [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/) and B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020.

Research Interest
======

My research focuses on developing **artificial intelligence for mathematical problem solving (AI4Math)**, with an emphasis on methods that require minimal or no human supervision. I currently pursue two primary directions: 

 * Large Language Model (LLM)-based mathematical reasoning
 * Neural approaches for combinatorial optimization (CO).

In addition, I apply CO to real-world applications such as high-performance computing, computer vision, biology, and information extraction. My earlier work spans self-supervised graph representation learning and reinforcement learning.
