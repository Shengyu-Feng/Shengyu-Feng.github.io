I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in [Language Technologies Institute](lti.cs.cmu.edu), Carnegie Mellon University. I am fortunately advised by Prof. [Yiming Yang](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./yiming/). Before that, I received my M.S. in Computer Science from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2022, and B.S.E in Computer Science from University of Michigan and B.S in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020.

Research Interest
======

My research focuses on the **discrete generative models** and **combinatorial optimization**, with application to text and graph data. 

In addition, I am dedicated to advancing **AI-for-Science** by developing machine learning methods to enhance the efficiency of distributed computing systems used in high-energy physics experiments.
